**Challenges:**

* **Difficult to accurately assess risk and user impact.**

  * Affects legacy systems still using 64-bit block ciphers (e.g., 3DES in TLS).
  * Hard to determine which internal or external-facing services still support or require these weak ciphers.
  * Some legacy applications or older third-party systems may break or lose compatibility when 3DES is disabled.

* **Large footprint, affects multiple services and endpoints.**

  * Requires scanning and patching across all servers, appliances, and network devices that offer TLS-based communication.
  * Web servers, load balancers, VPNs, and other encrypted endpoints must be individually evaluated.

* **Complexity of Implementation**

  * Ownership of change is unclear â€“ Network Security, EUC, Infrastructure, or App Teams may all be involved.
  * Disabling 3DES requires cipher suite configuration changes in OS, IIS, Apache, NGINX, or load balancer settings.
  * Some environments may require customer or third-party vendor approval before making changes.
  * Rollback may be complicated due to interdependencies or lack of documentation on services relying on 3DES.
