**Subject:** Feedback on Winget Implementation Items

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

Thank you for sharing the list of items to address for Winget. I’ve taken a first stab at consolidating feedback, and I’ll have my other team members add in where they see fit. Overall, we agree with the areas you’ve outlined, and would also like to highlight a few additional considerations—especially with the end goal of keeping Azul JDKs up to date:

* **Dependency Handling:** Confirm how WinGet will handle Azul JDK dependencies or side-by-side installations when multiple versions are required.
* **Compatibility Testing:** Validate that JDK updates through WinGet do not break applications that rely on specific JDK versions.
* **Version Pinning / Exception Handling:** Define a process for managing exceptions where applications require fixed versions of JDK.
* **Update Frequency:** Establish a cadence for Azul JDK update checks and deployments (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
* **Monitoring & Reporting:** Ensure compliance reporting and rollout visibility is available through SCCM/Intune dashboards.
* **Fallback Sources:** Clarify steps if Nexus does not have the required JDK package (backup source or delay strategy).
* **Security Validation:** Validate that all packages are signed and scanned to mitigate supply-chain risks.
* **Automation Readiness:** Assess scripting or automation opportunities for sync, submission, and deployment approvals.
* **Rollback SLA:** Define timelines for rollback in case JDK updates introduce issues in production workloads.
* **Stakeholder Approvals:** Ensure application owners are included in the approval cycle for JDK updates before rollout.

We believe addressing these items, along with your original list, will provide a more complete framework for safely leveraging WinGet, particularly for Azul JDK patching.

Best regards,

Do you want me to make this **shorter and more bullet-style** (quick reply format), or keep it **formal and narrative** like above?

Here’s a clean outline you can send as an email to your manager to summarize **current status** and the **plan forward** for Winget/ Azul JDK patching:

**Subject:** Status and Plan for Winget Implementation (Azul JDK Patching)

Hi [Manager’s Name],

As requested, here’s an outline of the current status and our plan regarding Winget adoption to help us keep Azul’s JDKs up to date:

**Current Status:**

* Other team has documented initial items for Winget usage (deployment process, Nexus integration, rollback, rollout methods, etc.).
* End goal is to leverage Winget for maintaining Azul JDK updates.
* Initial gaps identified include dependency handling, version control, rollback processes, and monitoring/reporting integration with SCCM.

**Plan (Next Steps):**

1. Review and finalize the checklist from the other team, including our feedback additions (dependency handling, version pinning, update cadence, security validation, monitoring/reporting).
2. Align with SCCM/Intune team on integration steps, notification process, and rollout options.
3. Define test strategy for JDK updates, including rollback/mitigation procedures and impact analysis for applications dependent on specific versions.
4. Establish ownership for package submission/maintenance, rollout approvals, and ongoing monitoring.
5. Set a target timeline for pilot rollout in SCCM with Azul JDK as the first package to validate the end-to-end process.
6. Document and communicate the governance process for long-term Winget usage across other apps (beyond JDK).

This will give us a clear framework for progressing with Winget adoption while ensuring reliability and minimal impact on business applications.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
