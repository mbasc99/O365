I wanted to share that my wife is expecting, with an estimated due date of March 25, 2025. Since the exact timing is uncertain, I will need to take 3–4 days off & will send the team the OOO calendar invite once she goes into labor.

I’ll do my best to provide a heads-up as soon as possible and will ensure the tasks that are assigned to me are completed well in advance and will coordinate any necessary handovers. Please let me know if there’s anything specific I should take care of before my time off.

In case of anything urgent, I already have your cell numbers and will reach out to you if absolutely needed.

Thanks for your understanding and support!
