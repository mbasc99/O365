**Subject:** Time Off Request – Family Matter  

Hi [Manager's Name] and Team,  

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to share that my wife is expecting, with a due date of March 25, 2025. As we prepare for this exciting time, I will need to take 3–4 days off around the due date to handle things at home.  

I’ll do my best to ensure a smooth transition and will coordinate any necessary handovers in advance. Please let me know if there’s anything specific I should take care of before my time off.  

Thanks for your understanding and support!
