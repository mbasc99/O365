**Subject:** Follow-up on Adobe Reader Vulnerabilities – DR VMs (Approx. 700 Systems)

Hi [MSP Team Name/Contact],

Hope you’re doing well.

Following up on the Adobe Reader–related vulnerabilities identified across the ~700 systems, I understand from your earlier note that these are **Disaster Recovery (DR) VMs** currently powered off and typically brought online only during **DR exercises or weekend maintenance windows**.

Could you please confirm **when these systems are next scheduled to be powered on** so that the pending Adobe Reader updates can be addressed? We’d like to ensure that the remediation work is planned and completed within the next available maintenance cycle, if possible.

Additionally, a few follow-up questions for clarity:

* Do you have an **estimated timeline or calendar** for the next DR exercise or maintenance window?
* Will the **updates be applied automatically** once the VMs are online, or will your team need to initiate the process manually?
* Are there **any dependencies or approvals** required from our side to enable patching during that window?
* Is there a **tracking mechanism** or status report we can reference to confirm once these systems are updated?

Thanks for confirming the above details — this will help us plan our internal vulnerability closure tracking accordingly.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
[Your Job Title]
[Your Department or Team Name]
[Your Organization]

Would you like me to make a slightly firmer version (for escalation or SLA tracking purposes), or keep it at this polite follow-up tone?
