**Subject:** Upcoming Time Off – Family Matter  

Hi [Manager's Name] and Team,  

I wanted to share that my wife is expecting, with an estimated due date of March 25, 2025. Since the exact timing is uncertain, I will need to take 3–4 days off once she goes into labor.  

I’ll do my best to provide a heads-up as soon as possible and will ensure a smooth handover of any ongoing tasks. In case of anything urgent, I already have your cell numbers and can be reached if absolutely needed.  

Appreciate your support and understanding!  

Best,  
[Your Name]
