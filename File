The new Azul Discovery Tool was tested in a controlled environment within the current SCCM infrastructure. Testing included verification of WMI class creation and inventory data collection without triggering LSASS calls. Results demonstrated successful data collection and no security or performance impacts. As the tool has been approved by the HCSC Cybersecurity team, there are no anticipated risks for production deployment.
