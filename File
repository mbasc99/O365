Here are the suggested entries for the **Description** and **Justification** fields in your ServiceNow change ticket:

### **Description:**
We are implementing a new Discovery Tool developed by Azul to replace the existing PowerShell-based discovery tool. The new tool is C# .NET-based and approved by the HCSC Cybersecurity and Defense team. Unlike the older tool, it does not trigger LSASS calls, improving security and system performance.

As part of this change, we need to add the **'AZUL_JavaLiveInventory'** class to SCCM Client Hardware Inventory. This will allow inventory data to be collected separately in WMI on client machines, ensuring a smooth migration and reducing the risk of missing inventory or misconfigurations.

Upon successful migration from Oracle to Azul, the previous Java discovery-based classes in WMI will be deprecated and removed from HCSC systems.

**Business Gain:**
- Enhances security by preventing LSASS call triggers.
- Ensures accurate inventory tracking during the migration process.
- Reduces risks of misconfigurations and data loss.
- Simplifies future decommissioning of legacy Java discovery classes.

---

### **Justification:**
The primary driver for this change is the adoption of a more secure and efficient Discovery Tool from Azul, which has been approved by HCSC Cybersecurity. The older PowerShell-based tool posed security risks by triggering LSASS calls, which could be exploited.

This change will improve security, streamline inventory tracking, and provide a structured approach to the migration. By introducing a separate **'AZUL_JavaLiveInventory'** class, we can validate the migration success before decommissioning the older discovery method. Once migration is complete, we will remove the outdated Java discovery classes from WMI, ensuring a clean and optimized environment.
