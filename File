Here’s the same update in a **clean bulleted format** for easy consumption:

---

### **Office Standalone Versions Cleanup – Status Update**

* **Progress**

  * Draft plan developed for uninstalling standalone versions of Office (2007, 2013, 2016).
  * UAT package creation in progress to validate uninstall process.
  * Systems with MODI installed identified as exceptions (to be excluded initially).
  * Bret is working on consolidating various O365 builds across the environment, which will gradually reduce vulnerabilities from outdated versions.

* **Assignments**

  * EUC Packaging Team → Develop and test uninstall package.
  * UAT Group → Perform testing and validate uninstall process.
  * Support Teams → Provide MODI replacement product instructions to impacted users.
  * Ops Team → Prepare for phased/controlled deployment post-UAT approval.
  * Bret → Lead O365 build consolidation to minimize security risks.

* **Plan**

  * Complete UAT testing with pilot group.
  * Exclude MODI systems and provide replacement guidance.
  * Deploy uninstall package to production in a throttled, controlled manner.
  * Continue parallel O365 consolidation effort to standardize builds and reduce vulnerabilities.
  * Target initial rollout before Change Freeze to optimize resource availability.

Do you want me to also make this **sharper for an executive audience** (very high-level, 1–2 bullets per section), or keep this **detailed team-level format**?
