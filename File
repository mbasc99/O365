Here’s the updated version with a more complete Microsoft Store endpoint list so the network/proxy/firewall team can check in advance:

**Subject:** Assistance Needed – Microsoft Store Apps Update Task

Hello \[Recipient Name],

Could you please provide an engineer from the Proxy, Network, or Firewall team to work with us on troubleshooting the Microsoft Store Apps Update task?

We have collaborated with the GPO team to configure and target the necessary policies to keep Microsoft Store Apps up to date. However, after reviewing error logs, event logs, and WMI logs, we believe the download of Microsoft Store Apps metadata may be blocked at the proxy, network, or firewall level.

From our analysis, the issue appears related to traffic to Microsoft Store endpoints such as:

```
*.microsoft.com  
*.msftconnecttest.com  
*.storeedgefd.dsx.mp.microsoft.com  
*.wns.windows.com  
*.dl.delivery.mp.microsoft.com  
*.emdl.ws.microsoft.com  
```

We’d like to work with someone from your team to review the relevant configurations, run any necessary tests, and help identify and resolve the source of the block.

Please let us know the appropriate point of contact and their availability to proceed.

Thank you,
