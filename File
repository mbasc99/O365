Sure! Here's a more polished and professional version of your draft:



Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

Given that this application is widely used across the organization, any modifications to the Oracle Java 8u202 deployment would require thorough testing and formal approval from the ECM Application Owners. Additionally, since the permissions script was originally provided by the Azul team, any adjustments to the install directory permissions would also need to be reviewed and approved by them.

My recommendation at this point is that, as we are currently in the midst of an active deployment of the ECM 4.0 package, we should hold off on addressing this issue immediately. Instead, I suggest we focus our efforts on the broader initiative of eliminating Oracle Java wherever feasible. I believe it would be best to avoid diverting resources to resolve this permissions matter at this critical stage of the project.

Once we have the necessary reviews and testing completed, we can incorporate a permissions fix into a future ECM package release.

At this time, this issue does not appear to be a showstopper or require our immediate attention.

Let me know your thoughts.

Best regards,

Got it! Here's a version with a more collaborative and team-oriented tone:

Thank you for digging into this and highlighting the concern.

Since this application is widely used across the organization, I believe any changes to the Oracle Java 8u202 deployment will need to be carefully tested and approved by the ECM Application Owners. Also, as the current permissions script was provided by the Azul team, we should involve them in reviewing any updates to the install directory permissions.

Given that we are actively deploying the ECM 4.0 package, my suggestion is to table this for now and continue prioritizing the broader effort of reducing Oracle Java usage wherever possible. I’d prefer we avoid getting sidetracked by this at such a key stage of the project.

That said, I agree this can be addressed in a future release once we’ve had the opportunity to fully test and get buy-in from all stakeholders. 

I’m happy to collaborate further on this and hear any additional thoughts you might have.

Best regards,
